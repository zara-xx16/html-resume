<h3>MY HOBBIES</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Digital Art
        <p>I found my passion for digital and
            traditional drawing back in the first
            lockdown. I have been
            drawing and improving a lot. And this
            has been my hobby for quite some
            time now. And I am
            still actively working on new art
            pieces. I hope to do some
            commissions further down the line.</p>

    <li>Sewing
        <p>During the summer of 2018, I did a lot
            of sewing lessons with one of my
            aunties who owns a
            fashion business. She taught me how
            to sew with the sewing machine. And
            at the end of the
            short course, I made a dress which I
            am very proud of.</p>

    <li>Coding

    <li>Fashion
        <p>I love fashion and everything about it, down to jewellery, shoes, makeup and different style aesthetics.</p>
